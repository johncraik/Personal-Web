      <!-- Intro: -->
      <p>
        My name is John Craik, aged 20, currently studying Software Engineering BEng at The University of Sheffield in the UK.
        I am extremely passionate about tehcnology and software development since I started high school back in 2015.
        This was much later on than most people in my classes who had been learning to code for many years before I started, but this did not stop me,
        it only empowered me to do better. However, technology is not the only thing I like. I have an interest in geography, gaming, politics and space to name a few.
      </p>
      <!-- Interests: -->
      <p>
        As mentioned above, I enjoy geography. I studied this at A-Level and it heavily infuenced my computer science A-Level project.
        I enjoy learning about the world we live in - both politically and geographical - and how are actions will impact the planet in the future.
        I am sure you have heard the term 'Climate Change', well it is a real threat to the planet and our society.
      </p>
      <!-- Education -->
      <p>
        When I started A-Levels in 2018, I began to self-learn C# programming language as my college only taught Visual Basic.
        Throughout the 2 years at college I had to develop my own software project of my own choice from start to finish.
